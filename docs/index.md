This  pilot project will prove that there is great possibiity for academic discussion and digital research into the text analysis of Presidental Speeches. In this project, I will use various text-mining tools to analyze the speeches by poltical party and compare the results. In this I hope to discover something substainal, or at least to inspire further research into text-analysis of speeches.
