# Workflow

The workflow for this pilot project was rather simple and straight-forward. This is laregly due to me recieving the data pre-webscraped and ready for input. Once I decided a topic for this pilot project, the steps to analyze them came farily easily.

First and foremost, I took the folder of presidential speeches and separated them based on political party. Based on the information provided by [ThoughtCo.](https://www.thoughtco.com/presidents-and-vice-presidents-chart-4051729), I made five new folders; Democrat, Democrat-Republican, Federalist, Republican, Whig, and  Unaffiliated. Using these divisions, I then uploaded them into [Voyant]( https://voyant-tools.org/). These visualizations serve as the basis for my pilot project. I then analyzed and compared the results from each political party.

Additionally, as a sample, I took George Washington's speeches and put them into [Orange3](https://orange.biolab.si/). I then used the workfow below, provided by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ5z2SRwzgs&list=PLmNPvQr9Tf-ZSDLwOzxpvY-HrE0yv-8Fy&index=5) on Orange3's offical youtube page, to iniciate hierchical clustering and analyze the resulting data.

I then screenshotted all my visualizations and uploaded them to Github, where I sorted and anlyzed the data and my findings. Although this is a solo project, I recieved input and advice from my fellow classmates, [Brandon Pearson](mailto:bpearson1@mail.usf.edu) and [ALex Ferreira](mailto:aferreira2@mail.usf.edu)
