## Basic Source Information

It should be noted that I attianed the data set via [David J. Thomas](mailto:davidjthomas@usf.edu) who had a prior student webscrape the data from it's original source. I did not do the actual webscrape for this pilot project.

* The data set came from [The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/).
* The APP provided transcripts of recorded, offical presidnetal address. The webscrape then turned the transcript into txt files organized into folders named after every US president.
* The source is hosted online by [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), and the data was originally obtained by Gerhard Peters and John Woolley in 1999, according to the [About Page](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/about) provided on the website.

## Authorship

* Is there any information available discussing the process by which the information was gathered, or how the digital project was constructed?
* How transparent is the project about the choices they made in gathering and transforming the data for digitalization? [Click here for an example of a an excellent 'About' page from a database about Anglo-Saxons](http://www.pase.ac.uk/about/index.html)
* Do the organizations or individuals involved in gathering and publishing your data set have any stated goals or agendas?
* Do the organizations or individuals involved seem to have any unstated agendas or goals?
* If a 3rd party funded the project, who are they? Do they have any particular perspective?

## Data Analysis

* It is probable that there may be some bias involved in the selection of the speeches chosen to a part of the dataset. The qualifications for what is considered a "presidental speech" is vague.
* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?
* What kinds of categorizations do you find in the data, and do they seem reasonable?
* Do the means of data collection or categorization affect how the data is constructed in any way?
* Does the website contain any tools for visualizing the data? Do they seem like they are making any kind of arguments?
