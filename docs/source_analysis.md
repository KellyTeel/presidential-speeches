## Basic Source Information

It should be noted that I attained the data set via [David J. Thomas](mailto:davidjthomas@usf.edu) who had a prior student webscrape the data from its original source. I did not do the actual webscrape for this pilot project.

* The data set came from [The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/).
* The APP provided transcripts of recorded, official presidential address. The webscrape then turned the transcript into txt files organized into folders named after every US president.
* The source is hosted online by [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), and the data was originally obtained by Gerhard Peters and John Woolley in 1999, according to the [About Page](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/about) provided on the website.

## Authorship

* According to the APP website, they state that "Our sources include nearly every document from two canonical collections of Presidential papers: Messages and Papers of the Presidents of the United States ("Richardson"), and The Public Papers of the Presidents. On an ongoing basis, we update regularly from the materials provided by the White House media office, the Government Printing Office, and the National Archives (NARA)."
It appears that the project and those who run it are very transparent about where they obtained their data, however, I would like to see more information about how these specific speeches were chosen, as well as what qualifies as an official speech.
* Because the APP originally just posted the transcripts of the presidential speeches, and they didn't convert them to a proper text-mining format, there is no information on how it was digitally constructed. As mentioned prior, a previous USF student did the webscrape and converted it into useable data.
* Regarding their goals for the project, he APP states "Our goal today is to be recognized as the authoritative, non-partisan on-line source for presidential public documents.  By providing easy access to useful information, we seek to promote a more informed citizenry of the United States, high quality scholarly and media analysis, and a better understanding of American democracy throughout the world."
* It is clearly stated that the APP is primarily supported via their [donor program](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/about/donor-support), however they did receive funding fro [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/) to redesign the website in 2014.

## Data Analysis

* It is probable that there may be some bias involved in the selection of the speeches chosen to a part of the dataset. The qualifications for what is considered a "presidential speech" is vague.
* The APP is also obviously very pro-American, which could lead to a bias that would exclude any presidential speeches that were controversial or unflattering to U.S. presidents. However I was not able to find evidence of such occurrences in my research.
