# Initial Findings

This is where you where you discuss any (initial) conclusions you have come to. This is also a natural place to put any and all visualizations that you come up with. In fact, this is where you tell the reader what it is you discovered. You can use the first person if that helps you discuss the process. This is where you both describe to the reader what they are looking at (if they are looking at a visualization) and, most importantly, what your interpretation of the results is.

The visualization above done in Orange 3, represents 21 speeches given by George Washington between the years of 1789 and 1796. Using hierarchical clustering, I was able to determine that are two distinct categories of Washington’s speeches. It appears that the first cluster (colored blue) is primarily formal speeches like were likely very basic as far as presidential speeches go. For example, his “First Inaugural Address” and his “Farewell Address” are included in this category. The second cluster (colored red) alternatively includes some more complicated speeches, such as “Talk to the Cherokee Nation” and “Talk to the Chiefs and Counselors of the Senate.” These speeches are more likely to be longer and cover a more controversial topic, likely leading to more clarification needed by President Washington and therefore more detail and complicated ideas. I cannot definitively say that this is the reason for these clusters, it very well could be an oversimplification on my part. More digging into the clusters of speeches are required for a more accurate analysis.

Whether you turn your visualizations into static pictures and put them here or embed them, you MUST discuss your visualizations adequately. That means that whoever is the visualization expert must explain what they think the visualization means. You should explain anything that is not self-apparent from the picture alone. Moreover, you should at least comment on whether you think you can draw broader conclusions from any of the visualizations, either when considered individually or all together.

If your project was less visualization-centric, this is where you at least explain in plain words what you learned through the process of non-visual analysis. For example, if you used text mining not for visualization purposes, but to help you manually find interesting threads of conversation in a body of documents.

You should also make sure to be a cautious scholar, and to think about the limitations of what the visualizations can actually tell you. As indicated by the section name, you are **not** expected to make hard conclusions that upend serious historical debates. Rather, this is a place to explore what might be learned from visual exploration.

You must also comment on where you would go next. If these are initial findings, where do you think the best profit would be for any future attempts. This is also where you can talk about pitfalls that limited your ability to learn more about the topic. How might future projects overcome these difficulties?
