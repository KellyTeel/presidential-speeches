# Problems and Possibilities

Unfortunately, I ran into numerous problems and difficulties with this project. Partially due to my lack of skill with more advanced programs like Orange3 and Tableu, but also because of general errors that occur when working in the digital humanities field. Additionally, I had a technical failure on my end that caused me to loss much of my work and derail my project. However, there are numerous ways that this dataset can be analyzed and further explored by those with more skill and time.

In Orange 3, I was planning on putting the data through hierarchal clustering and predictions, in which I hoped Orange would be able to tell if a speech was made by a Republican President or a Democratic one. For any future digital humanists, I would recommend using [this Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmNPvQr9Tf-ZSDLwOzxpvY-HrE0yv-8Fy&disable_polymer=true) created by the developers of Orange3.

Additionally, although I extracted a decent amount of information from Voyant, I still believe there is more to be found using this effective tool. If I had more time, I would definitely input every president's speeches individually, so I could analyze each president more closely and perhaps spot more differences and similarities than I have already.

Overall, I believe that analyzing presidential speeches based on party affiliation can tell us so much about American history, political parties, and the presidents themselves. I would be interested to see if any noticeable change over time occurred in terms of presidential speeches, and I hope to see other students and scholars tackle this concept in the near future.
