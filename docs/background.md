# Project Background

---
For my second project in the realm of Digital Humanities, I have chosen to analyze Presidential  Speeches based on party affiliation. I plan to first analyze the dataset as a whole, to uncover any similarities throughout the data. After, I will divide up data into six categories:

1. Democrat
2. Republican
3. Federalist 
4. Whig
5. Democratic-Republican
6. Unaffiliated

Using these categorizations, I hope to uncover some trends within the speeches based on political party. For instance, if  political  affiliation alters the most common topic of a president's speeches. Do Democrats discuss racism more than Republicans? Have Republican rhetoric changed over time as the party has drastically changed? These are just a few questions that I hope to answer in this project.

Put a general discussion of your topic here. Don't get into the historiography or scholarship here. Just introduce to your reader what your topic is. What is the 'problem', the 'question', and/or the 'argument'.

YOU SHOULD BE LIBERAL AND INCLUDE ANY AND ALL LINKS WHEN RELEVANT

## Historical Background

There have been many fascinating studies in recent years that focus on the verbiage and emotional impact of presidential speeches. For instance, [Nancy Miller and William Stiles 1986 analysis](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/stable/pdf/2786858.pdf?refreqid=search%3Abf19e1e2b0ff45c5cd24e57958659278) on the verbal familiarity in American Presidential Speeches between 1920 and 1981 was particularly groundbreaking in the subject matter. There are few instances before this of a proper text analysis of presidential speeches. In this piece specifically, the authors found that intimacy increased over time, and this resulted in a notable change in the verbiage used by the President. Often, they even saw this intimacy increase from a president’s inaugural speech to their final speech given as president. 

Beyond this 1986 study, there has been further analytical research into presidential speeches. However, these studies are often focused on a single president or a single decade in American History. For instance, [Anna Lazuka’s analysis](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/stable/pdf/42889053.pdf?refreqid=search%3Abf19e1e2b0ff45c5cd24e57958659278) of President George W. Bush’s presidential speeches between September 11th, 2001 and September 11th, 2003 is an absolutely fascinating read, with a subject matter that could be discussed at nauseum in conjunction with social analysis and theory. Similarly, [Donileen R. Loseke’s 2009 study](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/stable/pdf/40220142.pdf?refreqid=search%3Abf19e1e2b0ff45c5cd24e57958659278) “Examining Emotion as Discourse: Emotion Codes and Presidential Speeches Justifying War” is equally as fascinating and highlights the kind of academic discussion that can grow from text mining and analysis of Presidential Speeches.


Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

## Digital Background

You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
