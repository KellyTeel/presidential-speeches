# Project Background

---
For my second project in the realm of Digital Humanities, I have chosen to analyze Presidential  Speeches based on party affiliation. I plan to first analyze the dataset as a whole, to uncover any similarities throughout the data. After, I will divide up data into six categories:

1. Democrat
2. Republican
3. Federalist 
4. Whig
5. Democratic-Republican
6. Unaffiliated

Using these categorizations, I hope to uncover some trends within the speeches based on political party. For instance, if  political  affiliation alters the most common topic of a president's speeches. Do Democrats discuss racism more than Republicans? Have Republican rhetoric changed over time as the party has drastically changed? These are just a few questions that I hope to answer in this project.

## Historical Background

There have been many fascinating studies in recent years that focus on the verbiage and emotional impact of presidential speeches. For instance, [Nancy Miller and William Stiles 1986 analysis](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/stable/pdf/2786858.pdf?refreqid=search%3Abf19e1e2b0ff45c5cd24e57958659278) on the verbal familiarity in American Presidential Speeches between 1920 and 1981 was particularly groundbreaking in the subject matter. There are few instances before this of a proper text analysis of presidential speeches. In this piece specifically, the authors found that intimacy increased over time, and this resulted in a notable change in the verbiage used by the President. Often, they even saw this intimacy increase from a president’s inaugural speech to their final speech given as president. 

Beyond this 1986 study, there has been further analytical research into presidential speeches. However, these studies are often focused on a single president or a single decade in American History. For instance, [Anna Lazuka’s analysis](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/stable/pdf/42889053.pdf?refreqid=search%3Abf19e1e2b0ff45c5cd24e57958659278) of President George W. Bush’s presidential speeches between September 11th, 2001 and September 11th, 2003 is an absolutely fascinating read, with a subject matter that could be discussed at nauseum in conjunction with social analysis and theory. Similarly, [Donileen R. Loseke’s 2009 study](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/stable/pdf/40220142.pdf?refreqid=search%3Abf19e1e2b0ff45c5cd24e57958659278) “Examining Emotion as Discourse: Emotion Codes and Presidential Speeches Justifying War” is equally as fascinating and highlights the kind of academic discussion that can grow from text mining and analysis of Presidential Speeches.

## Digital Background

In this project, I utilize the free, online program [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) heavily. There are many excellent papers and articles detailing the text-mining tool, but I feel that [Alyssa Anderson's blog post](http://ricedh.github.io/02-voyant.html) is one of the best. She explains the various ways Voyant can be utilized for analyzing masses of text relatively quickly. This program was especially useful for this project because of its speed, as I was able to run multiple folders of speeches through the program very quickly with no error.
